  Install the Flottplot Python package from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flottplot">PyPI</a>
</p><pre>
pip3 install flottplot

  After loading the notebook extension with
</p><pre>
%load_ext flottplot
</pre><p>
  Flottplot cells can be created with a <code>%%flottplot</code> magic command.
  Flottplot elements added to the cell body will be converted when executing the cell.
  Each Flottplot cell is independent and elements cannot interact between them.
</p><p>
  Note that all images must be reachable from the root directory of the notebook server.
  Because JupyterLab does not serve images directly via URL, the extension does not work properly with the lab interface at the moment.

<h1 id="server">Access via SSH</h1>

<p>
  Your plots might be saved on a remote machine that you only have SSH access to.
  In this case instead of transferring all plots to your local machine, you can start a simple web server on the remote machine and use port forwarding to access your flottplot page in your local browser.
  Many machines have Python 3 installed nowadays, so we can e.g. use the <code>http.simple</code> server.
  By default, <code>http.simple</code> serves content on port 8000.
  When connecting with SSH, specify that port 8000 on the local machine should be forwarded to port 8000 on the remote machine:
</p>
<pre>
ssh -L localhost:8000:localhost:8000 user@remote
</pre>
<p>
    If you are using a config file for your SSH connections, you can permanently specify the -L option with
</p>
<pre>
LocalForward localhost:8000 localhost:8000
</pre>
<p>
  there. When the connection is established, start the webserver with
</p>
<pre>
python3 -m http.server
</pre>
<p>
  on the remote machine.
  It will tell you which port it is serving on.
  This port must match the one just specified in the SSH command.
  As long as the SSH connection is open, you can type
</p>
<pre>
http://localhost:8000
</pre>
<p>
  into your (local) browser's address bar to access the webserver started on the remote machine.
  The server will show you the content of the directory that it was started in and if there is a file named <code>index.html</code> it will serve this file immediately (you can also access other files by navigating with the URL in the browser).
  The server only has access to files inside that directory and its subdirectories, so if you want to access something that is saved in directory <code>~/aaa</code>, you should start the server in either <code>~</code> or <code>~/aaa</code>, but not <code>~/bbb</code>.
  This not just applies to your flottplot page but also all the plots that you include in your flottplot.
  Make sure you are using relative paths to reference files and employ softlinks to access remote locations you don't have a relative path to.
</p>
<p>
  The server can be stopped with Ctrl-C when you are done.
