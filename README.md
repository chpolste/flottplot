# Flottplot

Arrange and navigate collections of images in the browser


## About

Flottplot helps you to quickly build a user interface to navigate a collection of images named with a common pattern.
The project was conceived as tool to view plots of meteorological and climate data with the ability to put multiple images containing different variables next to each other and click through them synchronously.

Flottplot is in the public domain, so you can include it anywhere you want.
